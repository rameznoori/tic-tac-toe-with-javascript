# Tic Tac Toe with Node.js

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Node.js. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (❌ or ⭕️) on a 3x3 grid by selecting a position. The program checks for a winning combination after each move, declaring the current player as the winner if three marks align in a row, column, or diagonal. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. This project demonstrates the use of arrays, conditional logic, loops, and user input handling in Node.js for creating an interactive two-player game.
